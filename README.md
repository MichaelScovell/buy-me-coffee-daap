## Buy Me Coffee DAAP

### About the Project
This project continued to build upon the patterns and skills previously accquired during the React Minting Project, through the development of a decentralized version of the popular Buy Me Coffee website. The project enables users to purchase coffees through the site as well as provide a short message (simillar to the orignal application), by firstly connecting their metmask wallet before signing their transcation for the purchased coffee. Once signed, their purchase will appear on the site as well as their accompayning message.

This project followed the Alchmey Road to Web 3 Development projects:
